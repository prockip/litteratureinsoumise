**Saboteur of intellectual inbreeding.**
Writer, self-taught hacker of literature, and accidental philosopher.
Building [Littérature Insoumise](https://github.com/procki/litterature-insoumise) — where texts are **open-source**, AI is a **collaborator**, and elitism is **not welcome**.

📖 **Current obsessions:**
- Turning GitHub into a **literary workshop**.
- AI as a **co-author**, not a tool.
- **Offline publishing** (because not everyone has Wi-Fi).

🛠 **Skills:**
- Markdown → PDF/EPUB (with duct tape and GitHub Actions).
- Breaking genres like they’re **outdated APIs**.
- Writing **manifestos** that double as **code comments**.

💬 **Ask me about:**
- How to **sabotage literary gatekeeping** with open-source tools.
- Why **books should be forked** like repositories.
- My **failed attempts** at merging poetry with Python.

*Currently: Looking for **co-conspirators** to weaponize GitHub for art.*
